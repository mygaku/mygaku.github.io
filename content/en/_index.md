At Tsugumi Club, we challenge the very concept of "learning".
We believe that the core impulse should come from students themselves - our role is to show how fun learning can be and to provide guidance when it is needed.


## Features of Tsugumi Club

1. Small groups allow for interactive classes, where we don't just sit quietly and solve problems - everybody has a change to speak and be heard.

2. Parents can also participate!
Students do presentations, recitals and all sorts of performances - you would see the results of your child's progress right away.
And you can practice together at home ðŸ˜‰

## Policy

Study for entrance exams is not our goal.
We nurture the ability to think and create, currently though programming and "English" courses and aim at teaching skills which will be useful throughout student's life.

The lessons we offer are not just for fun. The content of the lessons far exceeds that of official educational programs in Japan. Nevertheless, we motivate children to learn by making them feel that the lessons are meaningful.

For advanced students who are not satisfied with standard school program, we offer a curriculum up to the graduate level with advanced materials.
