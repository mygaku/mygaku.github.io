Creative coding is about using programming for creative expression:
making aethetically appealing images, animation, music, etc. 
Perhaps the most well known form of creative ecoding is *algorithmic (also called generative) art*.
Creative coding and algorithmic art are closely related, but there's a subtle difference in focus:

- Creative coding is the broader practice. It's about using code for any creative purpose, not just art. This could involve making interactive installations, generating music, or even designing products. Think of it as the big tent that holds all sorts of creative projects made with code.
- Algorithmic art is a specific type of creative coding where the focus is on using algorithms (sets of instructions) to generate the artwork. The art itself is created by the code, often with a random or unpredictable element.

## Why algorithmic art

Algorithmic art can be a fantastic way to learn programming! Here's why:

- Engaging and Fun: Algorithmic art lets you create cool visuals and animations, which can be a lot more motivating than traditional programming exercises. Seeing your code come to life in a creative way can be very rewarding.
- Hands-on Learning: You'll be actively working with code to achieve artistic goals. This experimentation helps solidify your understanding of programming concepts like loops, variables, and conditional statements.
- Visual Feedback: Creating algorithmic art gives you immediate visual feedback on how your code is working. If something isn't right, you can see the results right away and adjust your code accordingly.
- Start Simple, Get Complex: Algorithmic art projects can be scaled to your skill level. You can begin with basic shapes and patterns and gradually progress to more intricate designs as your coding skills improve.






## Is AI art the same thing?

It's like using a paintbrush with code instead of paint.  Anyone can learn creative coding, even if you're new to programming. It's a fun way to merge your creative side with the power of computers.

Imagine coding as a tool, not just for building websites or apps, but for making art and creative projects. That's creative coding in a nutshell!

Here's the basic idea:

    Regular coding builds things that work, like a calculator or a to-do list app.
    Creative coding uses code to make things that are expressive, like animations, games, or even digital paintings.
