We accept kids from age 8 yeas old, adult classes are also available.

Our approach is to foster deep understanding of fundamental priciples while developing real applications 👩‍💻.

Course content can be adjusted for your individual needs and preparation level. If you don't know where to start, here are the recommended options:

## Python basics and fundamental algorithms.

🐍 Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly language that opens the door to endless possibilities. It's not just about coding; it's about problem-solving, creativity, and having fun while learning valuable skills for the future!

## Creative coding

🎨 Creative coding is where art and programming collide!
Rather than just building functional programs, we will use code as a tool for artistic expression.
The goal of this course is to not only achieve aethetically pleasing relusts (though it in itselv is a lot of fun!),
but also, while doing so, develop a solid command of Python programing language and essential coding skills.
From simple 2D graphic, we can venture into 3D, music, animation and game development, AI art - the sky is the limit.

        Dr. Aleksandr Drozd (Sasha) came  to Japan in 2010 to work on the development of supercomputers such as TSUBAME at Tokyo Institute of Technology and Fugaku at RIKEN. Prior to coming to Japan, he taught core programming courses at the Faculty of Computer Science at Moscow State University. Sasha started programming when he was a junior high school student and won many contests. Now a father of two, he is trying to teach children the joy of programming and develop the next generation of human resources.
